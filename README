# A default layout and configuration files for DevCMS can be created by using the DevCMS generator:

rails generate devcms

# You can overwrite the default DevCMS layout, by setting at the first line of "class Application < Rails::Application"

register_cms_modules

# Notes

* For new DevCMS applications, you should remove the default ApplicationController. If you'd like to keep it, you need to make it an extension of DevcmsCore:

  extension_of DevcmsCore
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    ...
  end
