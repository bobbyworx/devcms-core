# For DevCMS to run, you need to add some gems that are only available on Github. Add this to your Gemfile:

source 'http://gems.github.com'

gem 'calendar_date_select', :git => 'https://github.com/emyl/calendar_date_select.git', :branch => 'rails3_1'
gem 'prototype_legacy_helper', '0.0.0', :git => 'http://github.com/willbryant/prototype_legacy_helper.git'

# A default layout and configuration files for DevCMS can be created by using the DevCMS generator:

rails generate devcms

# You can overwrite the default DevCMS layout, by setting at the first line of "class Application < Rails::Application"

register_cms_modules

# Notes

* As we're not precompiling ExtJS and TinyMCE, the asset pipeline fallback should be enabled in production:

  config.assets.compile = true
  
* For new DevCMS applications, you should remove the default ApplicationController. If you'd like to keep it, you need to make it an extension of DevcmsCore:
  
  extension_of DevcmsCore
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    ...
  end
