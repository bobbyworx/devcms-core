- calendar_date_select has been updated and copies its files to the root app on load. This has been added to
  support date fields in contact forms
- mailer views will be loaded from devcms-core, the need for having all mailer vies in the root app/views is not necessary
  anymore unless the default has been intentionally overwritten
- contact_form_mailer/message views have been updated and therefore need to be updated in all other devcms root apps as well
- contact forms support file uploads. As these uploads are private, they will be stored in RAILS_ROOT/private/uploads. This
  will need to be symlinked in deploy.rb
